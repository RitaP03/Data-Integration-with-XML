# üß© **Data Integration with XML**

Java application developed for **data extraction, transformation, and integration** from heterogeneous web sources (Wikipedia and DB-City).  
The system consolidates country information into a structured XML document, ensuring **data validation, querying, and transformation** through modern XML technologies.  

---

## üöÄ Setup / Execution

1. Open the project folder DataIntegration_Project/ in **Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA**, or another Java IDE.
2. Ensure **Java 11** (or higher) and the required XML libraries (JAXP, XQuery processor) are configured.
3. Run the main Java class to start the data integration process.
4. The program will extract data from Wikipedia and DB-City, process it, and generate a validated XML file.
5. You can then use the provided XSLT and XQuery scripts to transform and query the XML data.
6. After these steps, the system will produce a structured XML dataset ready for analysis or visualization.
