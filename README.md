# üß© **Data Integration with XML**

Java application developed for **data extraction, transformation, and integration** from heterogeneous web sources (Wikipedia and DB-City).  
The system consolidates country information into a structured XML document, ensuring **data validation, querying, and transformation** through modern XML technologies.
